#### Strings : 

        sequence of characters
        String class is special and doesnâ€™t need to be instantiated with new.
                String s1 = "hello";//double quotes, first way
                String s2 = new String("hello"); // second way
                
#### concatenation : use operator "+"

        If both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition.
        2. If either operand is a String, + means concatenation.
        3. The expression is evaluated left to right. eg : 1 + 2 + "c " : output 3c

#### Strings are immutable : read string pool concept

        once string is created , value cannot be changed.
        String class is final
        fiels/instance variables private
        no setter method, allow constructor initailization at the time of creating object
