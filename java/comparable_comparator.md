Sorting can be in natural order or via a Comparable or many
Comparators.

Implement Comparable using compareTo(); provides only one sort
order.

Create many Comparators to sort a class many ways; implement
compare().

Use a lambda expression as a shorthand to create a Comparator.

To be sorted and searched, an array’s or List’s elements must be
comparable.

To be searched, an array or List must first be sorted.
