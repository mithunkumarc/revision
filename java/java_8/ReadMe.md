anonymous classes
lambdas
streams
functional interfaces
time package



1. Lambda expressions:

            anonymous class with single abstract method 
            or functional interface can be converted to lambda expression.

2. Method references,

            ContainingClass::staticMethodName  

3. Functional interfaces,

            single abstract method

4. Stream API,
5. Default methods,

            method with implementation.
            abstract method must be implemented by a class which implements an interface -
            even though it was not needed. default method fit in this case.

6. Base64 Encode Decode,

        
7. Static methods in interface,
      
            since interface cannot be instantiated

8. Optional class,

            better way to handle nullpointer exception

9. Collectors class,
10. ForEach() method,
11. Parallel array sorting,
12. Nashorn JavaScript Engine,
13. Parallel Array Sorting,
14. Type and Repating Annotations,
15. IO Enhancements,
16. Concurrency Enhancements,
17. JDBC Enhancements etc.
